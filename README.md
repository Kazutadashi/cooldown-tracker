# cooldown-tracker
A simple script that retrieves all the CD timers for League of Legends champion in a specified match. This program is designed to assist players in memorizing cool down timers for making decisions in lane battles, as the player who better memorizes cooldown timings often has more opportunity to outplay, or defend against their opponent.
